## The Ben-Or decentralized consensus algorithm

The Ben-Or consensus algorithm is making use of **randomness** to create consensus in a asynchronous network with eventual liveness guarantee.

---

## How to test the code 

1. Run the unit tests with the command `yarn test` and see how the implementation performs against the given tests
1. Modify the `start.ts` file with the parameters you'd like, launch the network manually with `yarn start` and see the results

## Algorithm Details

### Intuition of the algorithm

1. At first every process proposes their input value. 
1. After that, they propose random values.
1. **When enough processes propose the same value, the value is chosen.**
1. Eventually, that will happen!

### Setup

1. Protocol proceeds in **asynchronous rounds**, where each round has **two** phases.
    1. In the first phase of a round, each node tries to identify a value supported by a majority in order to propose that for the second phase.
    1. In the second phase (the decision phase), a node finalizes its decision if it finds the same value proposed by at least *f+1* nodes. 
1. For each phase, processes broadcast their input values and wait for *n - f* messages from the other processes.
1. Each message is tagged with the round and phase number. (And messages can be resent to deal with a lossy network. But once a message is sent, that value is **locked** in for that process for that phase/round.)

### Guarantees

1. Deterministic Safety by majority intersection
1. Termination with probability 1

### Pros and Cons 

Pros:

1. Processes without input values start by proposing *‚ä•*

Cons:

1. Performance is not predictable.
1. Convergence can still take multiple rounds.
1. Amount of communication needed is potentially high.
